Dashing through the code, in a Haskell way </br>
Solving puzzles left and right, on this coding day </br>
With a notebook and a pen, and a sharp mind to boot </br>
We're hacking our way through, with Haskell as our root </br>

Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, </br>
Writing Haskell code all the way </br>
Oh, what fun it is to code, </br>
In a functional way </br>

We pattern match and we compose, </br>
We abstract and we generalize </br>
We use higher-order functions, </br>
And a rich set of libraries </br>

We catch errors on the fly, </br>
With the help of the type system </br>
We avoid boilerplate, </br>
And make our code more rhythmic </br>

Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, </br>
Writing Haskell code all the way </br>
Oh, what fun it is to code, </br>
In a functional way </br>

So here's to Advent of Code, </br>
And to Haskell, our language of choice </br>
May our solutions be elegant, </br>
And our spirits never lose their voice </br>

Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, </br>
Writing Haskell code all the way </br>
Oh, what fun it is to code, </br>
In a functional way. </br>
