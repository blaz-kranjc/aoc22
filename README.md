# :star: Advent of Code 2022 :star:

'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house</br>
Not a creature was stirring, except for a mouse</br>
With a notebook and a pen, I sat at my desk</br>
Trying to solve Advent of Code, with Haskell as my tech</br>

I had chosen this language for its elegance and grace</br>
Its simplicity and concision, its power and its pace</br>
It's a functional language, with a focus on expressions</br>
And a rich set of libraries, for all kinds of sessions</br>

With its type system, I could catch errors on the fly</br>
And with its lazy evaluation, I could make my code more spry</br>
With its pattern matching, I could decompose complex data</br>
And with its higher-order functions, I could avoid boilerplate</br>

With Haskell, I could write code that's concise and clear</br>
And abstract away the details, so that the solution would appear</br>
With Haskell, I could solve the puzzles, one by one</br>
And have fun doing it, until the day was done</br>

So I sat at my desk, with a smile on my face</br>
And wrote some Haskell code, with a style and a grace</br>
And as I hit the "run" button, and saw the results come out</br>
I felt a sense of satisfaction, and a Christmas cheer no doubt</br>

For Haskell, my language of choice, had helped me solve the task</br>
And made the experience enjoyable, despite the challenges I had to ask</br>
So here's to Advent of Code, and to Haskell, the language of the stars</br>
Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night, from a Haskell aficionado.</br>
