# :star: Advent of Code 2022 :star:

'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, except for a mouse
With a notebook and a pen, I sat at my desk
Trying to solve Advent of Code, with Haskell as my tech

I had chosen this language for its elegance and grace
Its simplicity and concision, its power and its pace
It's a functional language, with a focus on expressions
And a rich set of libraries, for all kinds of sessions

With its type system, I could catch errors on the fly
And with its lazy evaluation, I could make my code more spry
With its pattern matching, I could decompose complex data
And with its higher-order functions, I could avoid boilerplate

With Haskell, I could write code that's concise and clear
And abstract away the details, so that the solution would appear
With Haskell, I could solve the puzzles, one by one
And have fun doing it, until the day was done

So I sat at my desk, with a smile on my face
And wrote some Haskell code, with a style and a grace
And as I hit the "run" button, and saw the results come out
I felt a sense of satisfaction, and a Christmas cheer no doubt

For Haskell, my language of choice, had helped me solve the task
And made the experience enjoyable, despite the challenges I had to ask
So here's to Advent of Code, and to Haskell, the language of the stars
Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night, from a Haskell aficionado.
